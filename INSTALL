Installation

Installing this program is done in good old fashioned Perl style:

* Get the archive (looks like you have it...)

tar -xzf hl7d-<version>.tgz

cd hl7d-<version>
perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=<wherever you want this stuff>
make
make test (none yet, but read the output!)
make install

A suggested install dir (PREFIX) is /usr/local/hl7d; all stuff will be
installed below this directory.

That's all folks!
